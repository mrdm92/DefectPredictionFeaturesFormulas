# DefectPredictionFeaturesFormulas
The dataset used for this project is the NASA defect prediction dataset. The code aims to fill in any missing values by leveraging the relationships between different attributes. To handle problematic values, instances of 0/0 and infinity have been replaced with 0 and 100, respectively.
